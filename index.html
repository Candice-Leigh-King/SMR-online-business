      <h5> But... I already bought products that promised the same thing and I'm STILL looking for answers</h5>
      <p>Part of you might be so tempted, but the other part might be saying "how is this retreat different from other products? I don't want to waste my money on another product that doesn't get me the results it promises." Well, that's the entire reason we created The Social Media Retreat.<br>The difference between this retreat and any other is that we didn't luck into any of this. We had no job and no back up plan. We forced ourselves to learn how to make money by creating online business with as beginner creators and nano influeners. Instead of focusing on an amazing service to offer clients, we focus on all the other aspects of content creation and online business like how to show your value to potential clients. See, you can be the best in your industry and have 100k followers... but if you don't know how to successfully pitch yourself and services then you are going to struggle with income consistency.</p>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5> But... I'm scared it won't work for me</h5>
        <p>You're asking the wrong question! Instead of asking, "What if it won't work for me?" ask "What if it does work for me?!" Look, we know that investing in a retreat can be really scary. Wow, we were all so terrified when we first invested in ourselves. We've used our last dimes to pay for courses, but we dove into this new world of social media learning and the results speak for themselves.<br>
        Here's the thing: we believe in taking mentorship from people who are where you want to be, so that you don't have to learn the long and hard way. We want you to save yourself time, trials, errors, and frankly, headaches. Show up, do the work, and we will pave the way for you. <br>
        Making decisions from a place of fear isn't going to help you achieve those massive goals you've got, is it?

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>But... I've tried everything already</h5>
        <p>You might think you've tried everything already, but we aren't buying that - sorry! You might have seen what others were doing, tried and tested a few things a few times, thrown a ton of spaghetti at the wall and then given up when it didn't stick.
        <br>We've been there and know that there are a couple reasons why things might not have worked out for you in the past. There could be an issue with your branding, or there could be an issue with your business or your pitching strategy.
        <br>If there's an issue with your branding, it could mean you aren't attracting the right audience or speaking to the right people. If there's an issue with your business it could mean you don't know how to charge correctly, if there's an issue with your pitching strategy it could be because you aren't reaching out to the right clients or doing all the necessary steps leading up to a pitch.</p>

SO many people think that you need to know exactly what online service to offer in order to make money as a content creator and that's simply NOT true! What you DO need is an idea, passion and a perfect business strategy. The content creation and online business bootcamp teaches you how to achieve all of that! </p>
